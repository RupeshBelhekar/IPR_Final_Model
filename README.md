# Quantum Machine Learning for Image Classification: A Comprehensive Analysis of Fashion-MNIST
This repository contains the implementation in Jupyter Notebook and analysis corresponding to our research paper "Quantum Machine Learning for Image Classification: A Comprehensive Analysis of Fashion-MNIST". The project will explore the integration of classical and quantum machine learning methods in image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
 
 🚀 **Project Overview**
Project Aim: The objective of this project is to illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of quantum-enhanced models for machine learning in solving the classification task of images. This project uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, as a benchmark for the analysis.
Evaluating the performance of hybrid classical-quantum models compared to traditional approaches: model scalability; quantum hardware constraints; accuracy versus performance trade-offs.

🧪  **Key Features**
Implementation using Quantum Circuit models via Qiskit.
Hybrids of classical neural networks and quantum layers
Comparisons with models such as CNNs
Visualization of both the training metrics and performance metrics
Deployment-ready Jupyter Notebook for replication.

📊 **Dataset**
The fashion-mnist dataset includes the following:
60,000 training images
10,000 testing images
Each image is 28x28 grayscale classified into one of the following categories:
T-shirt/top
Trouser
Pullover
Dress
Coat
Sandal
Shirt
Sneaker
Bag
Ankle boot
